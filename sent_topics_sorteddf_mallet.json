Previously, Massoud had been the head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). During his five-year term at WPI, the ECE department saw considerable growth in research expenditures, research output, industrial partnerships, undergraduate and graduate student enrollments, unrestricted funds and gifts, and visibility and recognition. It also rose 26 positions in the U.S News & World Report department rankings. Massoud obtained his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999. After that, he led a research and development group at Synopsys Inc., a leading electronic design automation software company. In 2003, he joined Rice University, where he was granted tenure at the ECE and computer science departments in just four years. ","Massoud\u2019s research interests reside in leveraging innovations in modeling, design and signal processing techniques to automate the design process of efficient computing and sensing systems targeting applications in health, computer systems and energy. He has successfully collaborated with numerous companies and government organizations on research projects. He published more than 220 papers in leading journals and conference proceedings. He is known for having developed the world\u2019s first realization of compressive sensing systems for signals, which is critical for the realization of highly complex biomedical implantable and wearable systems. Massoud has received many honors for his research and his service to the field. In 2009, he was elected to the IEEE Nanotechnology Council. In 2007, he was a recipient of the Rising Star of Texas Medal. Additional honors include the NSF CAREER Award in 2005, the Design Automation Conference Fellowship in 2005, the Synopsys Special Recognition Engineering Award in 2000 and two IEEE Best Paper awards. Massoud\u2019s contributions to his profession beyond his university work are extensive. He was named Distinguished Lecturer by the IEEE Circuit and Systems Society. He is the editor of Mixed-Signal Letters\u2014The Americas and has served as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems.

He was previously on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, and has held visiting appointments at a number of Universities and Research Institutes in Europe and Asia.","Dean Prastacos' professional interests are in the areas of management science, information technology, and their use for innovation and business transformation in the information society. He has published five books and approximately 70 papers in international academic journals and edited volumes. His papers have appeared in some of the top journals in his field, such as Management Science, Operations Research, Journal of Management, Information and Management, Long Range Planning, and others. One of his recent books on \u201cManagerial Decision Making\u201d has been translated in Chinese and published by Tsinghua University Press (2011). Another recent book he co-edited on \"Leadership through the Classics\" has been published by Springer (2013).","For his work on the logistics of perishable inventory he has been awarded the Edelman Award by TIMS\/INFORMS. For his work on financial management under uncertainty, he has been awarded the 1st prize of the Hellenic OR Society. His work on blood inventory management has been cited in the centennial issue of Science as exemplary OR work internationally. His work on competency modeling has been used worldwide as a basis for successful HR practice. His work on absorptive capacity has been selected among the best papers of the Academy of Management. In 2008, INFORMS honored him with an Honorary Medal for significant achievements in Operations Research. Throughout his career he has received numerous teaching excellence and exceptional contribution awards (2002, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010).","Dr. Prastacos possesses significant academic leadership experience. As dean at Stevens (since February 2012) he has launched a number of initiatives that have transformed the school from a school of technology management to an accredited school of business. Since he joined Stevens, a new strategic plan for the school has been developed and is being implemented; six new undergraduate majors and three new graduate programs were launched; undergraduate applications have more than  doubled, while graduate applications have tripled; a best-ever retention rate of 95% and a record placement record of 100% have been achieved. The number of research-active faculty has doubled, while publications in the FT50 journals have increased by 450%. Advisory boards were established and two newsletters were launched, significantly increasing the school\u2019s outreach. Faculty support and student-centric initiatives have been put in place; agreements with international business schools have been signed; and more. In May 2015, the school was granted accreditation by AACSB, the first non-STEM related accreditation in Stevens\u2019 140 years of history. In July 2015, it was formally renamed to the School of Business.","As Rector of AUEB (2007-2011) he spearheaded the internationalization of the university, increased the number of graduate programs offered, enhanced the research activity through internal funding, established the alumni association of the University, established several joint programs with European Universities through the EU program Hermes, launched the Business Confucius Institute of Athens (fully funded by the government of China - Hanban), and the International Entrepreneurship Chair (fully funded by the government of India - ICCR), increased significantly the fundraising, and more.","Prior to becoming Rector at AUEB, he was the founding director (1999-2007) of AUEB\u2019s International MBA Program (www.imba.aueb.gr), widely considered as the No. 1 MBA program in Greece. During his term, the program was accredited by AMBA (2005), gained international visibility, appeared in international rankings (2006), and grew to attract students from more than 25 countries. In 2010 the school was awarded \u201cThe Most Innovative Business School in Southern Europe, 2010\u201d. Dr. Prastacos was also the founding director (2000-2011) of AUEB\u2019s Management Science Laboratory (www.msl.aueb.gr), a leading ISO-certified management research center in Europe, that has attracted significant funding from the European Union and other national and private funding organizations.","Dr. Prastacos also has significant consulting experience.
