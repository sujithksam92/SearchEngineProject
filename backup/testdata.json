Any solid-liquid interfaces provide the environment for microorganism attachment and growth to cause bio-fouling. Bio-fouling occurs on a wide variety of surfaces, including industrial or potable water system piping, natural moist surfaces (bottom of boats and docks), living tissues (oral cavity), and biomedical devices, and is a growing global problem. Bio-fouling in industrial water-based process accounts for billions of dollars lost each year. In addition, as the wide use of biomedical devices and implants, indwelling device infections represent life-threatening circumstances account for the majority (> 80%) of hospital acquired infections. Because of the involvement of resistant mutants and biofilms, classical antibiotics are not effective. Current antibiotic impregnation is not an ideal approach which has many unsolved problems including short life-span, narrowed antibacterial spectrum, ineffectiveness towards resistant mutants, and the potential to hasten the antibiotic resistance process. We are working on polymeric antibacterial designed specifically for implants associated infections. Surfaces constructed from polymeric antibacterial can sense bacteria attachment and kill bacteria by inducing autolysis. Biomedical (catheters, stents, orthopedic and dental implants, wound dressing, and antibacterial textiles/) and wide industrial applications of new antibacterial materials (metals and various polymers) are being explored.", "B) Therapeutic Peptides. As biologically active molecule sand therapeutics, peptides have some many unique and unbeatable features in comparison with proteins. Bioactive peptides regulate many physiological processes, acting at some sites as endocrine or paracrine signals and at others as neurotransmitters or growth factors, and have positive impacts on human health, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities. Over the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion in the study on peptides, and this is likely to continue. We are interested in new peptide design and delivery technology aiming at developing new therapeutic peptides for wide pharmaceutical applications. The two focuses of our current peptide project are: 1\uff09Long life-span therapeutic peptides. All therapeutic peptides are sensitive to proteases and thus have very short life-span in the circulation which is usually insufficient for peptides to be fully exposed to the target tissue. Approaches such as amino acid replacement, polymer conjugation, and microparticulate encapsulation have been tried. Unfortunately, D-amino acid replacement and polymer conjugation may be associated with dramatic peptide activity drop while microparticulate encapsulations are accompanied by increased peptide retention in reticuloendothelial system (RES) to yield undesired toxicity to specific tissues and organs such as spleens and livers. We pioneered in utilizing self-assembly in peptides design and have successfully developed therapeutic peptides with greatly improved life-span; 2) Cell specific and permeable peptides. Due to the hydrophilicity nature and lack of defined structures, short peptides have no or extremely low cell targeting ability and cell permeability. Current conjugation approaches aiming at the poor cell selectivity and permeability will have dramatically and unavoidable effects on the biological activity of peptides. We have developed a single amino acid modification/mutation approach which can improve for selectivity or permeability of short therapeutic peptides with affecting their biological activities. ", "C)  Nano-Technology Enabled Bacteria and Cancer Cell Sensing. Recently, we are working on a nano-patterning technology which can be used in biosensor and other analytic devices in combination with specific molecules (peptides and signaling massagers) for high sensitivity molecular and cell (bacteria and tumor) sensing. Meanwhile, a novel nano-crystalization technology with targeting and controlled release properties is being studied for drugs (anticancer drugs, antibiotics) with poor solubility and limited therapeutic effectiveness.", "Recent Publications (2017-2018) ", "Liu T., Yang F, Wang X., Liang JF, Adhesive Gold Nanoparticles for Easy and Controlled Surfaces Coating.

Over a 30-year career in music, Harari has been fortunate enough to work on multiple Grammy nominated albums, Emmy Award winning programming for children educational content on PBS and musical themes for major sporting events, composed songs individually and collaboratively for albums ranging from rock, pop and jazz to spoken word. He contributed soundtracks to multiple TV shows (The Boy King- NBC,) Documentaries (Back To Gombin-Packer Productions, The Hoboken Jewish Community \u2013 An Oral History), and in 2005, Harari was commissioned as Sound Designer and recordist of the binaural project \u201cThe Hiding\u201d for the Holocaust Museum and Study Center of Rockland County, N.Y., which has received international accolades.", "Most recently as the first artist to collaborate with Bell Labs since the 1960\u2019s as part of Experiments in Arts and Technology (E.A.T.), Harari authored and produced \u201cThe Shannon Effect\u201d, a celebration of Claude E Shannon, the father of Information Theory.

This introduction to the world of tap dance led Harari to start designing \u201cInstruments\u201d for dancers that would respond acoustically, similarly to other wood based percussion instruments. His interest in technology also led to designing new microphones techniques using Piezo transducers and convertors to the language of MIDI, allowing dancers to use timbral colors previously reserved for synthesizers.  In addition to the credits with Hines, Harari\u2019s work with Savion Glover included; \u201cBring In \u2018Da Noise, Bring in \u2018Da Funk (4 Tony Awards 2006), Live (Barbra Streisand), Cannes Film Festival, and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, and also in the Spike Lee film \u201cBamboozled\u201d.

Taking the decades of experience creating and mixing sound in a variety of venues, and combining that with an appreciation of how the audience reacts in any particular venue, has led to the exploration of how sound inherently causes physiological reactions in our bodies.  Through his research into the field of Psychoacoustics, Harari believes that if we can map the brain while analyzing specific aural signals, we can open the door to understanding how to live better through innovative design specifically focused on sound profiles of our environment. Recently, Harari has added Clinical Researcher at Hackensack University Medical Center to the list of endeavors pursuing that goal in hospital environments.", "In his personal life, Robert remains involved in many areas of community service.

Experimental information establishes the basis for the selection of models and the level of theory for DFT calculations and then, in turn, results of the DFT calculations help to deconvolute and better interpret experimental data. In contrast with traditional catalyst models that assume a static surface, our approach of combining kinetic studies, IR and Raman spectroscopic measurements and DFT calculations with vibrational analyses allows us to develop new methodologies for describing dynamic catalytic surface changes under reaction conditions and, consequently, for a transformational improvement in the description, control and further development of catalytic processes.", " ", "1991-1995  Research Engineer, UOP, Guildford, Surrey, UK and Des Plaines, Illinois.", "Ph.D. (Chemical Engineering), University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, 2002.", "Graduate Diploma in Intellectual Property, University of London, England, 1991.", "B.S.

His dissertation was on Quantum-Information and Decoherence free Quantum-Computation, in order to advance Quantum Computing a step closer to reality. The framework developed during his research can now be applied to all Quantum systems including the practical Optical Cavity Electro-Dynamic System in order to perform error free Quantum Computation.\n\nFrom 2006-2007, he was a research associate at the Washington University, School of Medicine, where he worked on mathematical modeling of neuronal systems and their response to visual and vestibular stimuli, which helps explain and predict the perception of signals by the brain. From 2007-2009, he worked at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University as a post-doctoral researcher and Adjunct faculty. His work primarily focused on Hybrid Computing on heterogeneous platforms, such as FPGAs, Graphics Processing Units(GPUs) and multi-core processors. The goal of the research was to effectively utilize various computing architectures for scientific data and compute intensive problems. As different architectures play different roles in High Performance Computing, finding the right set of platforms to deploy a specific application involves both redesigning the algorithm to the underlying architecture as well as tailoring the hybrid platform to the problem.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011 as a senior research scientist, he was the lead behind the development of an optimized Molecular Dynamics simulation package implemented on GPUs, at the University of Delaware. The study benefits several high-impact applications such as drug-design, protein-ligand interaction and multi-scale modeling. The algorithmic redesign accompanied with sophisticated acceleration techniques specifically designed for the massively multi-core platform delivers highly competitive performance.

This module provides coordinated movement of the hip and knee joints according to normal physiological gait pattern. The research developed unique methods for the motion control and coordination of the pair of linkage mechanisms. One method controls the input crank of the linkage mechanism directly with servomotors based on a derived continuous motion profile.

Dr Veleni is also affiliated as a visiting lecturer with the School of Fine Arts, University of Granada - Master of Drawing and Master of Art Education. Dr Veleni has published several conference papers, scientific journal articles, exhibition catalogs and monographs and has given lectures in many institutions worldwide. In 2014 she published her PhD thesis on audiovisual experimentations in the arts, after receiving the Enyalion bequest from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. She has been the curator of three contemporary art exhibitions and the coordinator of two major programs supported by the European Commission. She has been the sound designer and music composer for the project \u201cMacedonia: from Fragments to Pixels\u201d, organized by ICS-FORTH and the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Her research and teaching interests include Art and Technology, Museum Education, Art Education, Digital Education, Visual Arts and Music.\n\nHer recently published book is a historical and interdisciplinary presentation of the visual arts-music relation, as expressed by the phenomenon of synaesthesia and the total work of art. The book follows the idea of unity of the arts with a comparative juxtaposition of art before and after World War II. It considers the many links between the two disciplines as envisaged by visual artists, musicians, critics, scientists and philosophers.\n\nShe is currently working on a research project on growing leadership through improvisation in the arts and on developing interactive systems for art performances and educational purposes.

With the objective of expanding the controllability of a dynamical system, we add independent reflex arcs that are triggered directly by the disturbance signals to feedback controllers. A 10 degree of freedom biped robot was prototyped using 3D printing techniques and control methodologies were developed to stabilize it. A hybrid analog-digital controller has been designed to improve the stability of the biped robot against sudden impact disturbances. In order to design the hybrid controller, a high-resolution dynamic model of the robot was developed in a physics-based simulation environment. A series of disturbance experiments were performed to characterize the robot attitude when the robot experiences the disturbances. A passive reflex action provided by a mass-spring pendulum was evaluated in the simulation environment.\nA computationally-effective method to design open-loop gait patterns by specifying eight key-points during the gait has been developed and evaluated. Since the joint flexibility is a significant factor affecting the gait stability, joint flexibility was incorporated into the model with torsional springs at each joint. The stiffness and damping coefficients of the servo motor were characterized to model the joint as a torsional spring-damper component. The simulation method for the flexible joint in the physics-based simulator was discussed and demonstrated. The expected deflections of joints were estimated from equations of motion and added to the joint angles. The modified angle profiles were validated by comparing the robot\u2019s attitude data from sensors mounted on the robot to its model predictions. Subsequently, a Center-of-Mass Jacobian based motion planning was also implemented for a feedback controller design to stabilize the locomotion by tracking the Zero-Moment-Point and Center-of-Mass trajectories.\nThis dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of a hybrid controller into a biped robot, controllability improvements by the added reflex actions and gait trajectory planning along with feedback control for the biped robot with joint compliances. The outcomes lead to effective locomotion design methods for biped robots with compliant joints. The broader impacts of this research are on enhancing the safety, simulation of compliant joint in 3D robotics simulators and enabling the insertion of low-cost additive manufacturing methods into the production of robust robotic systems.", "Publications: ResearchGate", "Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ\nDoctoral in Mechanical Engineering, Jun. 2015", "Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ\nMaster of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, May 2011", "Handong Global University, Pohang, South Korea\nBachelor of Science in Mechanical / Electronic Engineering, Feb. 2003", "Innovation and Entrepreneurship Doctoral Fellowship 2012 - 2014"]}, {"name": "Ilham Ibrahim", "fc_id": 2122, "fc_desig": "ADVISOR: CONSTANTIN CHASSAPIS", "fc_content": ["An Approach to Variation Risk Management in Design and Manufacturing Using Process Capability Data\n\nFor decades the utilization of Process Capability Data (PCD) using traditional quality control techniques was limited to monitoring products quality and conformity with design requirements. Utilizing data in a proactive quantitative manner to improve current designs or develop new designs was overlooked. Despite the large amount of data continuously gathered and stored in data bases within the majority of existing industries, such data were not fully utilized or modeled to solve product development problems such as manufacturing variation. Manufacturing variation is the unwanted dimensional deviations from nominal values that impact products final performance and quality. Some existing factors hinder the achievement of design requirements and are referred to as product/process \u201cuncertainties\u201d. Uncertainties are responsible for the initiation of part/process variations during different design and manufacturing activities. The degrading nature of processes and procedures increases the uncertainties. Failure to address the uncertainties during the design process tends to increase variations. Therefore, lack of knowledge about current processes performance during early product development stages leads to the initiation of manufacturing variations. The risk of manufacturing variations is due to their propagating nature especially for assemblies and parts with interrelations.\nIntegrating PCD with the early design stages and decision-making techniques becomes essential in the product development process. The goal is to develop effective mechanisms to help mitigating manufacturing variation and unwanted deviations to reduce loss in time, money and efforts especially when manufactures are under the pressure of competing in tough economic conditions.\nThe work here focuses on certain existing challenges facing the product development process. Among such challenges is the design engineer\u2019s ability to predict the influence of the current processes performance and capability and express such behavior in a proactive model to create a robust design and set criteria for design decision making regarding the identification of the critical design attributes. Giving the propagating nature of variations, another challenge is the ability to monitor the propagation of variations and determine acceptability limits for controlling variations. This issue is important because not all variations are having significant impact on performance. Another challenge is to formulate all variations prediction activities to work in harmony under the broadest risk management procedure to represent variation risk management. It is important to manage the risk of variations without overworking current resources or increasing time and cost of investigation.\nTo overcome previous difficulties facing the design and manufacturing processes, a novel methodology that models the relationship between the design process and the expected process performance is introduced. The new methodology is capable of quantifying and comparing the impact of current process capability on target performance due to variations initiation. It helps in identifying the design variables more relevant to variations and then work on mitigating their effect to improve total design performance. An algorithm is proposed that quantifies deviations from design target and monitors their accumulation along with a variation prediction technique to guide the design engineer in case accumulated variations are of potential to cause significant impact on future yield. This work can be utilized effectively for a variety of purposes such as; differentiating between design tradeoffs, define risk criteria to monitor performance, and predicting the expected variations accumulation on parts before production. It can be integrated with practical tools such as 3D CAD/FEM analysis and statistical techniques to perform an integrated variation risk evaluation environment.", "Publications: ResearchGate", "M.S.
